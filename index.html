                <div class="para"><p><span> Human life is interesitng. We come in this world alone and leave alone. But the people who we share our lives with
make it worth living. I want to be the person who gives you immense joy, love, care and respect all your life because you are one beautiful person who deserves this.
                    Love is not something that you can express in words. Love is something that is felt with the heart.
 I barely talk to anyone without spending much time with him/her but the day i saw you jaan i heard something from within me that said
you are the one i wanted in my life. You are the most precious thing in my life.

The longest distance ever is a step away from touching your face.
The most annoying situation is missing to see your smile and the most painful of all is not loving you daily.
This day holds a special place for me, I am not with you now but
I want to spend all your birthdays by your side doing nothing but holding your hands Siddhi.
I hope you are as happy as you should be today and always.
Happy birthday my darling
